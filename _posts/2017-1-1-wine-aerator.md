<h2>What is a Wine Aerator?</h2>

A Wine Aerator mixes air into the wine as it flows through the pourer by increasing exposure to oxygen and causing aeration. This offers a much more classy and comfortable alternative to swirling a glass of wine or to simply waiting for the wine to breathe.

The included Chill Rod serves as a bottle cooler which maintains your wine at the optimum temperature for your best drinking experience without dilution or compromising the quality of your wine.
